# TASK-1-Superstore-Sales-data-Analysis-Dashboard

## Short Description / Purpose:

I built this interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize sales performance using dummy Superstore sales data.
The goal is to clearly show trends, top products, and segment-wise performance — to help business teams make data-driven decisions faster.

## Tech Stack:

Power BI Desktop
DAX (for calculated columns / measures)
Public dataset (Superstore sample CSV)

## Data Source:

The data comes from a sample Superstore dataset (CSV file) with details like:
Order ID, Product Category & Sub-Category
Sales, Profit, Quantity, Customer Segment
Region, Order Date & Ship Date
It’s a flat file structured to easily slice and analyze by different dimensions.

## Features / Highlights:

Business problem
How to track & understand sales performance across regions, products, and customer segments.

# Goal of the dashboard:

## To quickly see:

Total sales, profit, and quantity by Region, Category, Sub-Category
Monthly sales trend & top 10 products by sales
Sales by customer segment
All filtered dynamically by Year, Region, and Category.

## Walkthrough of key visuals:

KPI cards: Show overall sales, profit, and quantity.
Drill-down charts: Region → Category → Sub-Category with drill mode.
Trend chart: Monthly sales over time.
Bar chart: Top 10 best-selling products.
Slicers: Year, Region, Category to filter all visuals interactively.

## Business impact & insights:

Identify best & worst performing product segments.
Understand which regions drive most profit.
Track monthly trends to plan inventory & marketing.
Quickly spot customer segments contributing most to sales.
